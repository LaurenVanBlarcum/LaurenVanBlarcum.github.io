According to the graph there has been a steady decline in war related front-page headlines from WWI to the war in Afghanistan. The graph contains only two colors grey and green the purpose is to draw the readers eye to the front-page headlines for the war in Afghanistan. This does focus the reader's attention on what the author wants them to focus on. The author has numbered 3 of the bars specifying the number of headlines however there is no detailed y-axis which makes it difficult to understand the number of headlines per year for each war. A significant issue is what is measured in the graph. What is not considered is the change in how news is communicated. WWI occurred from 1917-1921 and the way news was distributed was significantly different than it was for the war in Afghanistan from 2000-2018. The graph depicts newspaper headlines but does not consider other forms of news such as websites, television, and radio.\n\nLove, Juliette & Nordland, Rod. Why Afghanistan Became an Invisible War.
